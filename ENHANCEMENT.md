How to run locally
Open any HTML file in a browser. No build required.
For dynamic menu, data/menu.json is fetched; ensure files are served via a local server if your browser blocks file fetch (use VSCode Live Server or python3 -m http.server).
How to test
Menu page:
Try the tabs and search; watch live results announcement.
Click a sweet crumbs to open lightbox; use arrows/ESC; swipe on mobile.
Contact page:
Fill required fields (name, email, phone); pick enquiry. Submit to see confirmation modal. Errors show inline.
Promotions:
Featured sweet crumbs render dynamically and open size modal.
Validation
HTML/CSS/JS lint recommendations followed; inline warnings resolved.
Accessibility:
Tabs are keyboard navigable; search has ARIA status; modals include proper focusable controls.
Notes
If serving over file://, dynamic JSON fetch may be blocked; use a local web server.
